The Simulation of Movable Bridge project exemplifies the capabilities of OpenGL in creating dynamic hardware simulations. Through OpenGL functions, users interact with hardware components, observing their behavior on-screen. This project aims to provide an immersive demonstration of a movable bridge simulation, complemented by a bustling cityscape where cars navigate roads and planes soar through the skies. Users control the simulation by toggling its operation with the 'S' or 's' key, and refreshing it with 'B' or 'b'.


Simulation Process
Upon activation with 'S' or 's', the movable bridge simulation begins. The train signal turns red, and the bridge ascends, facilitating the ship's traversal. Meanwhile, cars navigate city roads, and planes grace the skies. After the ship completes its passage, the bridge resets, and the train signal switches to green, allowing the train to cross. Users can pause the simulation with 'S' or 's' and restart it with 'B' or 'b', providing dynamic control over the simulation's flow.


Overall, the "Simulation of Movable Bridge" project offers an immersive and interactive exploration of dynamic hardware simulations, seamlessly integrating user interaction with captivating visual elements. Through its richly detailed environment and intuitive controls, users are invited to embark on a captivating journey through the intricate dynamics of bridge operations within a bustling urban landscape.
